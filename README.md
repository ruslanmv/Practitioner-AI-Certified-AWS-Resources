# AWS Certified AI Practitioner (AIF) Resources and Exam Study Path

**Last Updated:** September 7, 2024

## Introduction

The AWS Certified AI Practitioner (AIF) certification is a foundational-level certification aimed at individuals looking to demonstrate knowledge of artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML) services offered by AWS. This certification is suitable for anyone interested in understanding how to implement AI and ML solutions, whether they are beginners or professionals looking to validate their skills.

This certification exam has just entered the **BETA** phase, meaning it is now available for early access at a discounted rate. While in BETA, the exam may contain some experimental features, and participants are encouraged to provide feedback that AWS can use to refine the final version. Notably, those who pass the BETA version will earn an “Early Adopter” badge, highlighting their contribution to AWS’s certification evolution.

## Exam Details

The AWS Certified AI Practitioner (AIF-C01) exam tests the ability to understand AWS AI services and identify appropriate solutions based on specific business needs. The BETA version of the exam uses the code **AI1-C01**, though both are essentially the same. This foundational-level certification is ideal for anyone starting their journey in AI and ML.

You can find all the exam details on the [AWS Certification page](https://aws.amazon.com/certification/certified-ai-practitioner/).

- **Question Types:** Multiple-choice, multiple-response
